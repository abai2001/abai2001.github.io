Hello! I'm Andy and I work at the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division. Before working at the Antitrust Division, I worked in management consulting and economic consulting. I graduated from Northwestern with a double major in Economics and Mathematics.

In my free time, I like to read academic papers (mostly behavioral economics and antitrust law/economics) and teaching myself new things, I'm currently learning Networks through Professor Jon Kleinberg's lecture notes. As such, I figured it would be fun to create a website that catalogues all of my learnings.
