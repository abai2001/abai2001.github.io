Hello! I'm Andy and I work at the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division. Before working at the Antitrust Division, I interned in management consulting and economic consulting. I graduated from Northwestern with a double major in Economics and Mathematics.

In my free time, I like to read academic papers (mostly behavioral economics and antitrust law/economics), teach myself new things, and run long distances (the goal is a sub 2:55 marathon). I'm currently learning Networks through Professors David Easley and Jon Kleinberg's textbook and (re)learning Probability Theory because, as it turns out, it's a really useful thing to know. 

I decided to create this website because I want to (1) blog my thoughts on the papers that I've read, (2) post my notes for the subjects that I've taught myself, and (3) post some personal writing on whatever my mind happens to be thinking about. If you've stumbled upon my page, then I hope you can learn something. And if not, thanks for visiting and feel free to reach out to me about anything!
